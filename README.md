machine learning final project 24

I made a music generator using RNN and had a few tries.
I got the sample data of classical piano musics in the form of MIDI files and made a music with it.
The output was lot less than I expected it to be. It had no musical rhythm of harmonic sounds but only had imperfect chords and monotonous beats.
So the conclusion is it generated some sound with the timbre of a piano but it is hard to say it is beautiful music but merely just sounded like a child playing with the piano.
